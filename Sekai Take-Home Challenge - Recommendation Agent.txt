Sekai Take-Home Challenge
Build a tiny squad of AI agents that learns to recommend the right stories to the right fans—exactly what you’ll do with us in production!
________________


1 / Mission
Write code that iterates on a recommendation prompt until it consistently picks 10 highly-relevant Sekai stories for a user, given:
* 5 sample Sekai stories (below).
Use these as seed data—expand to ≈ 100 stories with an LLM of your choice.

* 1 full user profiles (below). we will create another user profiles to test it at the end.


You’re free to choose any multi-agent framework, model stack, or hosting setup.
________________


2 / High-level Flow to Implement
Agent:Prompt-Optimizer. Purpose:Proposes prompt tweaks based on prior evaluations. Model Guidance:Any model you like.

Agent:Recommendation Agent. Purpose:Returns 10 story IDs for a simulated new user. Must be fast. Model Guidance:GPT-3.5-turbo 

Agent:Evaluation Agent. Purpose:(1). Read a full user profile. (2). Simulates the tags that user would tick on Sekai’s first screen.
(3). Feeds those simulated tags to the Recommendation Agent. (4). Computes an eval score against “ground-truth” recommendations produced directly from the full profile. 
Model Guidance: GPT-3.5-turbo

	
		

Orchestrate them in an autonomous loop: optimize → recommend → evaluate → feedback → repeat until you hit a self-chosen score or time budget.
________________


3 / Ground Truth & Scoring
   * Ground-truth list: Ask your Evaluation Agent to recommend directly from the full profile + full story pool.

   * Metric: Pick something sensible (e.g., precision@10, mean-recall, semantic overlap). Tell us why.

   * Target: Stop when your metric plateaus or time runs out.
